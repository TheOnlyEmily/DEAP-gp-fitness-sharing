# DEAP-gp-fitness-sharing
Fitness sharing is a method to promote diversity in genetic programming. 

This is done by reducing the fitness of a possible solution by some factor proportional to how simillar it is to existing solutions.

While this library was intended to work with DEAP, it can be used with any genetic programming library. Assuming that library is written
in python.
